I think I have more blog post about setting up blogs than I have on anything else, and its been a while since the last one so I thought it about time for another one. I like the concept of static generation for blogs and first incarnations used Octopress, a blogging framework based on Jekyll, but the workflow and content produced wasn’t really working for me so it was time for a change.

I decided to look at [Wyam]( https://wyam.io/), I knew of a few folks using it and as it using .NET and Razor much of it had a familiar feel I was comfortable with. I’m not going to go into detail on setting it up, their site has comprehensive coverage on [getting started](https://wyam.io/docs/usage/), using [Github Pages and AppVeyor](https://wyam.io/docs/deployment/appveyor) for deployment. I did start off trying to be smart and automate the markdown conversion but the reality was I didn’t have much so opted for the manual approach. Hopefully I’ll have a couple of useful posts before the next blog post and blogs posts.
