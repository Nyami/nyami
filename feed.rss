			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whilst it’s relatively easy to &lt;a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=asp.net+core+2+with+vue"&gt;find and follow a guide&lt;/a&gt; to get up and running with Vue and ASP.NET Core, you’ll probably find there are a number techniques, methods, and opinions and there isn’t really the ‘first class’ support and 'simple' method of getting started as there is with Angular. In the following series of posts we’ll take a look at repurposing and using some of Microsoft’s SpaServices to create better support for Vue.js within your new ASP.NET Core project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dotnet-new-angular"&gt;dotnet new angular&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get started creating our own stuff for Vue lets look at creating an Angular project using the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.DotNet.Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates/"&gt;Microsoft's template&lt;/a&gt; and see what it gives us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have the &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download"&gt;.NET Core SDK&lt;/a&gt; installed (tested with 2.2), at a location of your choosing, drop to your prefered terminal and type &lt;code&gt;dotnet new angular&lt;/code&gt;. We now have a fairly sparse, and if you've worked with ASP.NET, familiar, project created. Let's break it down a little:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ClientApp folder - a Hello World Angular app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controllers folder - contains a simple api to 'fetch' weather data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pages folder - not much here, just the Error page (MVC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties folder - launchsettings used for debug/development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wwwroot folder - static assets for the side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appsettings.json - application setting, appsettings.development.json allows for development time settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foo.csproj - the aspnet project file, more information below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program.cs - application entry point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startup.cs - Configures services and application request pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about ASP.NET Core apps the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-2.2"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; is the best place to head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="startup.cs"&gt;Startup.cs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most ASP.NET applications the magic is coordinated in Startup.cs, there are typically two main parts, &lt;code&gt;ConfigureServices&lt;/code&gt;, where we configure and register services required by our application, and &lt;code&gt;Configure&lt;/code&gt;, where we configure the request handling pipeline. If you open Startup.cs you'll see the template has added some SPA related code to each of these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first block of code, as well as adding MVC configuration, it adds configuration telling the middleware where to expect to find the files for the SPA application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

    // In production, the Angular files will be served from this directory
    services.AddSpaStaticFiles(configuration =&amp;gt;
    {
        configuration.RootPath = &amp;quot;ClientApp/dist&amp;quot;;
    });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this next block we can see there are two points of interest for our application, &lt;code&gt;app.UseSpaStaticFiles()&lt;/code&gt;, which uses the configuration above to serve the static files for the SPA and &lt;code&gt;app.UseSpa&lt;/code&gt; which will return the default SPA page for any unhandled requests, its important this is the last middleware in our pipeline as it essentially acts as a 'catch all' on the assumption the route will be matched by our client side app. You can also see that when in development there is a call &lt;code&gt;spa.UseAngularCliServer(npmScript: &amp;quot;start&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, this will call the npm script specified, wait for it to start successfully, and will 'proxy' calls in to the webpack web server started, and is what we'll go on to replicate for our Vue implementaion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    // Code removed for brevity

    app.UseSpaStaticFiles();

    app.UseMvc(routes =&amp;gt; {
        //Code removed for brevity
    });

    app.UseSpa(spa =&amp;gt;
    {
        // To learn more about options for serving an Angular SPA from ASP.NET Core,
        // see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=864501

        spa.Options.SourcePath = &amp;quot;ClientApp&amp;quot;;

        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            spa.UseAngularCliServer(npmScript: &amp;quot;start&amp;quot;);
        }
    });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id="csproj-file"&gt;.csproj file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project file has a couple of extra targets when compared to a vanilla MVC project file, these are used to assert that npm has been installed when the project is being built and another target is used to add our Angular application to the published output. The project also ensures the ClientApp folder is not handled as part of the default build and publish behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="but-what-about-vue"&gt;But what about Vue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at what Microsoft's template provides this is the exact experience we are hoping to achieve but for Vue. There are really two parts to the Angular and ASP.NET Core story, the SPA middleware that hooks up Webpack at development time and serves the SPA’s static files, and the template getting us up and running ensuring a consistent experience. In the next part we'll take a look at the middleware and see how far it can take us for Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Mics, Camera, Action!</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2019-05-03-mics-camera-action</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year we ran a successful &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group"&gt;funding campaign&lt;/a&gt; at Aberdeen Developers .NET User Group to purchase some gear to allow us to record some of our sessions. We had a good idea of what we were wanting to achieve, essentially, we wanted to be able to publish recordings of our sessions and we weren’t wanting to spend hours processing the content after the recording. With a couple of events successfully in the bag I thought it might be worth sharing our setup, so here it is...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With a couple of events successfully in the bag I thought it might be worth sharing our setup, so here it is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the magic is done using &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/"&gt;Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)&lt;/a&gt;, a free and open-source streaming and recording program, but before we dive into our config let’s run down our hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microphones, probably one of the most important things for me, personally I can’t follow any video with poor sound. We have a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07F3KLX14"&gt;wireless lapel mic&lt;/a&gt; for the speaker and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07F3V3LD2"&gt;wireless handheld mic&lt;/a&gt; for the host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01DRWCOGA"&gt;Elgato Game Capture HD60 S&lt;/a&gt;, this is an awesome bit of kit, it allows us to capture the output from the presenter's laptop without having to install anything on their laptop, we also have an HDMI splitter just in case any DRM protection interferes with the process, but we've not encountered this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006A2Q81M"&gt;Logitech C920 HD Pro Webcam&lt;/a&gt; mounted on a tripod just to make things a little more interesting to watch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06W2KLM3S"&gt;Elgato Stream Deck&lt;/a&gt; to make scene selection nice and simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good selection of cables, USB, HDMI and power cables as well as a USB hub to keep thing tidy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src="images/ADNUGRecordingGear.jpg" alt="A selection of stuff" style="width:250px;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above OBS provides much of the magic, each of the input sources above can be toggled in OBS. We have 3 different scenes; presentation, web cam directed at the speaker, and a composite of the two, which we can cycle through depending on how the presentation is going, we can also toggle each of the microphones as required. OBS can record and stream via two separate controls within the application, we have OBS setup to stream to &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/adnug"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and record to disc, thankfully both have worked well on the night. Once recorded we only have to put the recording though ffmpeg trimming as required before uploading to our &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnxcmrSrc4TWKqakE4EViw"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll hopefully get a few more sessions recorded so make sure subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnxcmrSrc4TWKqakE4EViw"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; so you don't miss out. If you are interested in setting something similar up and have questions please reach out if I can be of any help.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Custom HTTP Verb</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2019-03-03-custom-http-verb</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are server reasons you might look to implement a custom HTTP Verb in you ASP.NET application, and thankfully with ASP.NET Core it’s incredibly simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2019-03-03-custom-http-verb</guid>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are server reasons you might look to implement a custom HTTP Verb in you ASP.NET application, and thankfully with ASP.NET Core it’s incredibly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a nice simple example of a WEBDAV inspired SEARCH verb, potentially useful if you’re encountering limitations of GET, perhaps because you can't have a GET with body, hitting the URL length limit, or just want to have consistent verb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class HttpSearchAttribute : HttpMethodAttribute {

        private static readonly IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; SupportedMethods = new[] { &amp;quot;SEARCH&amp;quot; };

        public HttpSearchAttribute() : base(SupportedMethods) {
        }

        public HttpSearchAttribute(string template) : base(SupportedMethods, template) {
            if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(template)) {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(template));
            }
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your custom attribute you can apply this to any controller action and start using your verb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// SEARCH api/values
[HttpSearch]
public ActionResult&amp;lt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Search([FromBody] string value) {
    return values.Where(v =&amp;gt; v.Contains(value)).ToList();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fully working, simple example is located over at &lt;a href="https://github.com/Nyami/WebApiSearchMethod"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Blog 2.0</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2019-03-02-blog-2_0</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think I have more blog post about setting up blogs than I have on anything else, and its been a while since the last one so I thought it about time for another one. I like the concept of static generation for blogs and first incarnations used Octopress, a blogging framework based on Jekyll, but the workflow and content produced wasn’t really working for me so it was time for a change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to look at &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt;, I knew of a few folks using it and as it using .NET and Razor much of it had a familiar feel I was comfortable with. I’m not going to go into detail on setting it up, their site has comprehensive coverage on &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/docs/usage/"&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/docs/deployment/appveyor"&gt;Github Pages and AppVeyor&lt;/a&gt; for deployment. I did start off trying to be smart and automate the markdown conversion but the reality was I didn’t have much so opted for the manual approach. Hopefully I’ll have a couple of useful posts before the next blog post and blogs posts.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>dotnet sln add</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2018-08-17-dotnet-sln-add</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I'd created a number dotnet projects and supporting solution using the command line so I had to refer to the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to keep me right. As I had just created a number of projects adding each one to the solution is a little tedious so when I'd spotted I could use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)"&gt;globbing patterns&lt;/a&gt; I thought this would save time and a few key presses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I ran &lt;code&gt;dotnet sln Foo.sln add **/*.csproj&lt;/code&gt; I was presented with the error &lt;code&gt;Could not find project or directory **/*.csproj&lt;/code&gt;. It turns out that globbing is not actually supported by the CLI but actually a shell feature and PowerShell wasn't expanding the glob. Luckly as dotnet is cross platform and I have &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10"&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt; installed with all the dotnet goodness I could switch to &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, ensure globbing was enabled using &lt;code&gt;shopt -s globstar&lt;/code&gt;, and then run &lt;code&gt;dotnet sln Foo.sln add **/*.csproj&lt;/code&gt; to add all my new projects, job done...&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'll be helping out at &lt;a href="https://rguhack.uk"&gt;RGUHack&lt;/a&gt; this coming weekend so I thought I'd pull together a few links from &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/index#pivot=products&amp;amp;panel=all"&gt;some of the Azure services&lt;/a&gt; available which might help the students build something awesome a little quicker. Hopefully the students have taken advantage of Github's &lt;a href="https://education.github.com/pack"&gt;Student Developer Pack&lt;/a&gt; to pick up some free Azure credit, but if they haven't, its easy to get started for free at &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/"&gt;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hosting"&gt;Hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/"&gt;Azure Web Apps&lt;/a&gt; will let you host your web application without having to manage infrastructure and you can be live in minuets. As you might expect Azure Web supports web applications created using &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet-framework"&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet"&gt;Core&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-html"&gt;Static HTML&lt;/a&gt; but it also supports &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-php"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-nodejs"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-python"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-java"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="compute"&gt;Compute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great features of Azure are &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/"&gt;Azure Functions&lt;/a&gt;, these allow you run your code on demand without having to consider the infrastructure, coupled with &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/"&gt;Logic Apps&lt;/a&gt; Azure Functions can help build powerful workflows to solve many problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a little more power or require to be a little closer to the actual OS you can spin up a virtual machine or two. Options include various flavours of &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/virtual-machines/linux/tutorial-create-vmss"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and of course &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/virtual-machines/windows/"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, alternatively you could create and use &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/container-instances/"&gt;Containers&lt;/a&gt; to get something up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="storage"&gt;Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#pivot=products&amp;amp;panel=storage"&gt;lots of solutions&lt;/a&gt; for storing data in Azure, most commonly used are &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction#blob-storage"&gt;Blob&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction#azure-files"&gt;File&lt;/a&gt; storage, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction"&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview"&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/redis-cache/"&gt;Redis Cache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cognitive-services"&gt;Cognitive Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things get interesting, the smart people at Microsoft have created a huge range of services that I have no doubt will help accelerate just about any idea at a Hackathon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="text"&gt;Text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is full of text, be it tweets, Facebook posts, news articles, emails, or much more. Azure have a range of services that can help analyze text content, so if any of the challenges call for some text analysis like detecting fake news, one of these features are going to make things a whole lot easier! &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-spell-check/proof-text"&gt;Spell check&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-sentiment-analysis"&gt;Sentiment Analysis&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-keyword-extraction"&gt;Key Phrase Extraction&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-language-detection"&gt;Language Detection&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator-text-api/"&gt;Text Translate Services&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="images"&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameras are just about everywhere, web cams, phones, drones, dash cams and even door bells! If any of the challenges require you analyse the images from any of those devices Cognitive Services has a series of APIs and tools to help. You can &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/emotion/home"&gt;Detect Emotions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/"&gt;Recognise Faces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Custom-Vision-Service/home"&gt;Create a Custom Image Classifier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/content-moderator/overview"&gt;Moderate Content&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/csharp#optical-character-recognition-ocr-with-computer-vision-api-using-ca-nameocr-a"&gt;Extract Text from images&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/csharp#GetThumbnail"&gt;Generate Image Thumbnails&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/csharp#analyze-an-image-with-computer-vision-api-using-c-a-nameanalyzeimage-a"&gt;Extract Visual Features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="speech"&gt;Speech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Azure provides &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speaker-recognition/home"&gt;Speaker Recognition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Speech/Home#speech-to-text-speech-recognition"&gt;Speech to Text&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Speech/Home#text-to-speech-speech-synthesis"&gt;Text to Speech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator-speech-api/"&gt;Translation to and from 10 languages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="video"&gt;Video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not limited to analysing images or speech, you can analyse video as well. Cognitive Services includes &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/video-indexer/video-indexer-overview"&gt;Vision APIs for videos&lt;/a&gt;. With these APIs you can perform face detection and tracking, motion detection, image stabilisation and video thumbnail generation. It's also possible to use the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/video-indexer/video-indexer-overview"&gt;Video Indexer&lt;/a&gt; to get an audio transcript, track faces, map and understand which speaker spoke which words and when, determine when a scene changes and a whole lot more!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Simple ping Middleware</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2018-02-09-simple-ping-middleware</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself needing to create a simple ping endpoint often used by load balancers as a quick check to see if traffic can be directed to your site, rather than complicating the simple and creating an MVC controller etc consider simple middleware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself needing to create a simple ping endpoint often used by load balancers as a quick check to see if traffic can be directed to your site, rather than complicating the simple and creating an MVC controller etc consider simple middleware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASP.NET Core request pipeline consists of a sequence of request delegates, these delegates are configured using &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.RunExtensions?view=aspnetcore-2.0"&gt;Run&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.MapExtensions?view=aspnetcore-2.0"&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.UseExtensions?view=aspnetcore-2.0"&gt;Use&lt;/a&gt;, and for our simple ping endpoint Map is a perfect fit. Map will create a branch in the pipeline allowing you to break out of the normal flow which could have the advantage as it can keep this as lightweight as you need. The following can be used to return a 200 response to indicate our site should be good to go, if you need to add some health checks or additional logic you could create more complex middleware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.Map(&amp;quot;/ping&amp;quot;,
  ping =&amp;gt; ping.Run(async conext =&amp;gt; await conext.Response.WriteAsync(&amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;)));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on Middleware check out &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?tabs=aspnetcore2x#writing-middleware"&gt;ASP.NET Core Middleware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Creating a Self-Signed Certificate for Identity Provider</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2017-11-18-creating-a-self-signed-certificate-for-identity-provider</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’d recently had to create a self-signed certificate for use in IdentityProvider4 and was coming up against problems when using the default options with New-SelfSignedCertificate PS module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identity Server was throwing "CryptographicException: Invalid provider type specified" and I had ensured the user account had access so it should have been all good. After a little bit of digging it turned out the private keys were not accessible from .NET. David Christiansen’s &lt;a href="http://blog.davidchristiansen.com/2016/05/521/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; helped me track down the issue but with a little more research I ended up with the following PowerShell to create a working certificate avoiding additional steps I didnt understand ;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$idSrvCertificate = New-SelfSignedCertificate `
    -Subject &amp;quot;CN=MyIdentityProviderCert&amp;quot; `
    -FriendlyName &amp;quot;Identity Server Token Signing&amp;quot; `
    -CertStoreLocation &amp;quot;cert:LocalMachine\My&amp;quot; `
    -KeyAlgorithm RSA `
    -KeySpec Signature `
    -KeyLength 2048 `
    -KeyUsage DigitalSignature, KeyEncipherment, DataEncipherment, CertSign `
    -NotBefore (Get-Date) `
    -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(5);

$username = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name;

$keyname = (((Get-ChildItem cert:\LocalMachine\my | Where-Object {$_.thumbprint -like $idSrvCertificate.ThumbPrint}).PrivateKey).CspKeyContainerInfo).UniqueKeyContainerName;

$keypath = $env:ProgramData + &amp;quot;\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\&amp;quot;;
$fullpath = $keypath + $keyname;
icacls $fullpath /grant $username`:RX;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating the certificate it will also ensure the current user has read access to the private keys avoiding the need to run VS elevated when developing, this last part could obviously be extracted and reused for your application pool if running Identity Server in IIS.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Bash - I forgot sudo</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to running Bash on Windows like me chances are you’ll type some huge long command only to be presented with a nice message telling you that permission was denied and then you realise you forgot “sudo”.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A great and easy way to avoid the double-bounce issue and prevent getting duplicate entries etc is to use the &lt;a href="http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/button/examples/singleclick/defaultcs.aspx"&gt;SingleClick&lt;/a&gt; property of the RadButton.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>A Blog Is Reborn</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2016-07-09-a-blog-is-reborn</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, I started off with the best intention of blogging more regularly but 18 months between blog posts was not quite the cadence I was aiming for! Shortly after setting up the blog I rebuild my machine and completely failed in setting up Octopress, following my own steps in ["A Blog Is Born"] just wasn’t working, I was encountering more problems than I knew how to fix I think because most of the tools weren’t playing nicely with each other on Windows so I gave up in a huff until an easy solution came along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bash-on-windows"&gt;Bash on Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year at Build Microsoft announced the ability to run native Bash on Ubuntu on Windows! Apart the obvious advantages of being able to use cmatrix or cowsay I was at first a little indifferent about the announcement until I realised that this might actually mean I could get Octopress working on Windows, so if all goes to plan this will be my fool proof guide to setting up Octopress using Bash in Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="installing-bash"&gt;Installing Bash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to run Bash on Windows you’ll need to be running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (currently available to Insiders) and then you will need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn-on Developer Mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable the &amp;quot;Windows Subsystem for Linux (beta)&amp;quot; feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it, for more information and a more in-depth guide check out &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about"&gt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="install-the-basics"&gt;Install the basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are up and running with bash you’ll need to install the basic tools using apt-get, here’s the list that I used to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nodejs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ruby1.9.1-dev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bundler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then pulled down everything from Github and picked up the usual Octopress workflow, and if all goes to plan this should be live within the hour.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>TFVC and NuGet Updates</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2015-01-07-tfvc-and-nuget-updates</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At some point, for no obvious reason, I kept encountering an error when updating some NuGet packages, the error (TF14092) was basically telling me a file could not be modified as there was a pending delete. Experience has taught me that there is generally a reason for sudden changes in behaviour and after a little analysis I eventually worked it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At some point, for no obvious reason, I kept encountering an error when updating some NuGet packages, the error (TF14092) was basically telling me a file could not be modified as there was a pending delete. Experience has taught me that there is generally a reason for sudden changes in behaviour and after a little analysis I eventually worked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We currently use TFS2013 for version control, our main solution uses Visual Studio 2013 and we rely on a number of packages from &lt;a href="http://www.nuget.org/"&gt;NuGet&lt;/a&gt; as well as an internal repository for internal or licensed 3rd libraries. Historically this has not always been the case, we've upgraded the solution through various versions of Visual Studio and TFS has also been upgraded from TFS2010, but the occurrence of this problem didn't appear to tie in with either upgrade. What I eventually worked out was that I had been using a server workspace long after the primary project had been upgraded, it wasn't until I was free of some of our older projects that I upgraded to a &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb892960.aspx"&gt;local workspace&lt;/a&gt; that had actually introduced this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I realised the root cause the solution was simple, I created a new workspace on my PC but ensured it was a server workspace, opened the solution from this workspace and upgraded my NuGet packages, I could have alternatively changed the existing workspace from local to server but I think local workspaces work better for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For future reference the full error is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 error(s) encountered attempting to perform the add operation on 1 item(s) First error encountered:
TF14092: The item $/SOMEITEM cannot be changed. A parent of this item has a pending delete which must be checked in first.
See output tool window for information on any other errors.

			<title>A Blog Is Born</title>
			<link>https://www.nyami.uk/posts/2014-12-14-a-blog-is-born</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So I've decided to start a blog, not for the first time, I've had a few attempts on a couple of different platforms from a custom web app to &lt;a href="http://umbraco.com/"&gt;Umbraco&lt;/a&gt; and I've probably got stuff on Geeks with Blogs and Blogger too. This time I'm going for an Octopress and GitHub Pages combo and I know little of either! Thankfully both are fairly well documented and hopefully be able to learn a few things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So I've decided to start a blog, not for the first time, I've had a few attempts on a couple of different platforms from a custom web app to &lt;a href="http://umbraco.com/"&gt;Umbraco&lt;/a&gt; and I've probably got stuff on Geeks with Blogs and Blogger too. This time I'm going for an Octopress and GitHub Pages combo and I know little of either! Thankfully both are fairly well documented and hopefully be able to learn a few things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first post will hopefully detail how to get started, &lt;strong&gt;[SPOILER ALERT]&lt;/strong&gt; I guess if you are reading this then this has proven to be successful. I'm using my trusty Surface Pro running Windows 10 Tech Preview so a good starting point looks to be &lt;a href="http://thaiat.github.io/blog/2014/03/13/how-to-install-and-use-octopress-on-windows/"&gt;How to Install and Use Octopress on Windows&lt;/a&gt; so let's see how this goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-the-basics-installed"&gt;1. Getting the basics installed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started we'll need a couple of things installed and &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; is the best place to start this process! Once installed (or updated in my case) the following packages should be installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install ruby -version 1.9.3.54500&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install ruby.devkit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install python&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="install-octopress"&gt;2. Install Octopress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everything is installed and the command prompt is restarted lets get Octopress installed, configured and deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git nyami.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd nyami.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install bundler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;notepad .\_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; and update properties and save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo www.nyami.uk &amp;gt;&amp;gt; source/CNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake new_post[&amp;quot;A Blog Is Born&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake generate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake preview&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake setup_github_pages[https://github.com/Nyami/nyami.github.io.git]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at this point I got the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Set the codepage to 65001 for Windows machines
** Invoke setup_github_pages (first_time)
** Execute setup_github_pages
rake aborted!
ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8
C:/GitHub/nyami.github.io/Rakefile:393:in `strip'
C:/GitHub/nyami.github.io/Rakefile:393:in `blog_url'
C:/GitHub/nyami.github.io/Rakefile:344:in `block in &amp;lt;top (required)&amp;gt;'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using the command &lt;code&gt;chcp 65001&lt;/code&gt; at this point didn't help so I had a quick peek at &amp;quot;Rakefile&amp;quot; not really knowing what it is but the problem looked to be around the CNAME file created above so I changed the encoding to ANSI and tried again and this time it was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm going to try get this up on Github... lets see what happens...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;
So looks like everything worked using the following workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;first commit of Octopress blog&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin source&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was surprisingly easy, hopefully over the next few months I'll get some new posts up...&lt;/p&gt;
